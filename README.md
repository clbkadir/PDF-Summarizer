## PDF-Summarizer
This is a PDF summarizer application built with Python, HuggingFace and Streamlit. Users can upload PDF files, and the application processes them to generate concise summaries using a language model. Actually, this project is a prototype that demonstrates how LLMs can be utilized with Python to provide services to users, rather than being a fully developed and complex tool.
